A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and navigate the World Wide Web (WWW). It 
is the primary interface through which individuals interact with websites, web pages, and other online content.
Web browsers interpret HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and other web 
technologies to display web pages and enable users to interact with them.

Some popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera. They 
provide features such as tabbed browsing, bookmarking, history tracking, and support for plugins and extensions. 
Web browsers also support various security measures, such as blocking malicious websites and protecting user 
privacy.
