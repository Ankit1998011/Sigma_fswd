A browser engine, also known as a rendering engine or layout engine, is a core component of web browsers that 
interprets and displays web content. It is responsible for parsing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web 
technologies and rendering them on the user's screen.

Browser engines work by downloading web documents, interpreting the markup code, and then rendering it into a 
visual representation that users can interact with. They handle tasks such as rendering text, images, and 
multimedia, laying out and positioning elements on the web page, applying styles and formatting, and executing 
JavaScript code.

Each web browser typically has its own browser engine, which may have unique features, performance characteristics, 
and levels of standards compliance. Some popular browser engines include Blink (used in Google Chrome and 
other Chromium-based browsers), Gecko (used in Mozilla Firefox), WebKit (used in Safari and some other browsers), 
and Trident/EdgeHTML (used in older versions of Microsoft Edge).
