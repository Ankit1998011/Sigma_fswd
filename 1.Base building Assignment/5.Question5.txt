A dynamic site is a type of website that generates content and responds to user interactions in real-time. 
Unlike static sites, dynamic sites use server-side processing and may rely on databases, scripting languages, 
and other technologies to dynamically generate and update web pages.

Dynamic sites can display personalized content based on user preferences, perform complex calculations or data 
manipulations, handle user input through forms, and provide interactive features like user registration, login 
systems, and e-commerce functionalities.

These sites often utilize server-side programming languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript 
(with Node.js) to process user requests and generate dynamic content. They may also interact with databases to 
retrieve and store data.
