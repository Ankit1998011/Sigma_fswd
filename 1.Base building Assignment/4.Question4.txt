A static site refers to a website that consists of fixed files that are served exactly as they are stored. 
In other words, the content of a static site does not change dynamically based on user interactions or data 
from a database. Instead, all the pages of a static site are pre-rendered and delivered to the user as static 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Static sites are typically composed of plain HTML files and may include additional assets such as images, stylesheets, 
and JavaScript libraries. The content on a static site is static and does not rely on server-side processing or 
database queries to generate the web pages.
